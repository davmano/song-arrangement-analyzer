# 🎵 Song Arrangement Analyzer

A full-stack web application that analyzes uploaded songs and generates intelligent arrangement suggestions based on structure, timing, and more.

This app is built for musicians, arrangers, and producers who want to gain quick insight into a song's sections and explore custom arrangements through both automation and manual editing.
